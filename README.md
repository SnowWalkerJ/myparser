# myparser

This is a practice project trying to mimic Python using lex and yacc.

## Currently supported grammars

- [x] Assignment
	- e.g. `a = 1`
- [x] Arithmetic
	- e.g. `a = (a + 1) * 2`
- [x] Print 
	- e.g. `print a`, `print 2 + 3`. Currently it's a syntax like as in Python 2. Intend to implement it as function once function calls are implemented.

## Plans

- [ ] Function call (this prior to `Function definition` because there are built-in functions)
- [ ] Function definition
- [ ] Flow control (this can be a little tricky)
- [ ] Multiple data types (currently only int is supported)

Object-oriented programming is not in plan because I have no idea how to implement it.
